        How it deals with import statement
        ==================================
        
        Let me summarize introduce of it simply.
        
        - recognize "import ..." sentence and "from ... import ..." sentence ...
        - turn the import sentence into function codes
        - combine the function codes into one file
        
        In recent version, it can deal with "import ..." sentence basically, but not enough.
        
        Supported Sentence

            from bs4 import BeautifulSoup  # will completely import even though that function not use exterior lib
            from bs4 import *
            # some libraries are not written by user. so it's line of codes will be preserved.
